# ASA-Datafest-2021-

From the description at https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/events/asa-datafest-2021-virtual:
"
The American Statistical Association (ASA) DataFest is a celebration of data in which teams of undergraduates work around the clock to find and share meaning in a large, rich, and complex data set. This year's Datafest will be held virtually.

...

After two days of intense data wrangling, analysis, and presentation design, each team is allowed a few minutes and no more than two slides to impress a panel of judges. 
"

While my team did not win any prizes, it remained a wonderful experience that taught me how to work as a team under the pressure of the two-day presentation deadline. This project also sparked my interest in data science and machine learning: I dabbled with data visualization for this project and was quite interested by the results.
